# Ming Deng
 Welcome to my page, my name is Ming and here you will learn about me.
## Thank you for your interest
---------------------------------------
**I am currently a fourth year here at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I am studying electrical engineering and economics. I will be graduating next may with a two bachelors degree. A little bit about me, I am from St. Louis, Mo, so far in college I have done 3 internships learning about industrial engineering and how a factory assembles and workers move packages. An interesting fact about me is that I can speak 3 languages.** 

These links will take you to the topic of thing that I am interested in

If you are interested in learning Chinese these are the websites that I use to help learn different languages. Youtube provides many different videos that are great for learning basic-intermediate Chinese. The BBC website will help you with the pinyin and learn how to write with the stroke orders.

# Block of Code

*Some of code sample written by me. This was a code written to  develop a complete assembly program based on the given auxiliary board hardware. The program should be able to control the LEDs on the board to switch them off or on. It will perform bit-wise operations and Interface with the LEDs on the auxiliary board through GPIOs from the raspberry Pi.*


# Assembly

	gpio_base:    .word	0

.global main

main:
	@ Assume that the GPIO base address
	@ has already been loaded
	
	
	ldr r3, =gpio_base
	ldr r5,[r3]
	bic r5,r5,#0b111<<6       //GPIO2
	orr r5,r5,#0b001<<6

    add r5,r3,#40
